      <h1>Emoji Fall FAQ</h1>

      <h2>Is Emoji Fall free to play?</h2>
      <p>
        Yes. Emoji Fall is a completely free browser game. You can play as many runs as you like
        without creating an account or installing anything.
      </p>

      <h2>Do I need to download an app?</h2>
      <p>
        No download is required. Emoji Fall runs directly inside modern desktop and mobile browsers.
        Just open the site, hit Play and start dodging ghosts.
      </p>

      <h2>Which devices are supported?</h2>
      <p>
        The game is designed for both desktop and mobile. Arrow keys are supported on desktop, and
        swipe controls are supported on mobile. For the best experience, use a recent version of
        Chrome, Edge, Safari or Firefox.
      </p>

      <h2>Is there a time limit?</h2>
      <p>
        There is no fixed time limit. Each run continues until you collide with an obstacle or the
        boss while not invincible. Advanced players can survive for a long time by using power-ups
        wisely.
      </p>

      <h2>Do you store my scores online?</h2>
      <p>
        Scores are currently stored locally in your browser. This means they are visible only on
        your device. In the future, online leaderboards may be added.
      </p>

      <h2>Can I share screenshots or videos of the game?</h2>
      <p>
        Absolutely. You are welcome to share gameplay screenshots and short clips on social media or
        in your blog posts as long as you link back to the game homepage.
      </p>
