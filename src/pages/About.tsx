      <h1>About Emoji Fall</h1>
      <p>
        Emoji Fall is a small HTML5 project built to explore how far a simple idea can go when it is
        polished for smooth controls, cute visuals and short-session gameplay. It is designed to be
        the kind of game you open during a break, play for one or two minutes and then happily close.
      </p>
      <p>
        The game focuses on three things: responsive movement, readable patterns and satisfying
        power-ups. Boss encounters and daily-style challenges are layered on top to keep long-term
        players engaged without making the game complicated.
      </p>
      <p>
        Emoji Fall is also optimized for SEO and modern web features, making it easy to discover via
        search engines and easy to embed in tool hubs or casual game collections.
